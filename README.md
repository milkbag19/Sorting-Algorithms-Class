# Sorting-Algorithms-Class
This is simply a class that can be used as an object to access several different sorting methods that I created myself.  (and yes i know some Aren't original, but I Brain stormed them myself)
In the graphic below, I compiled test data from two of the sorting methods within the classfile.  

The two being my fastest (quick bubble sort) which I made completley myself, and the other is Selection sort which I made as a practice method.

As you can see, the two methods are similar with small datasets, but as the amount of elements increases, the difference between the two methods becomes obvious.  

While selection sort is a quick and easy way to sort small data sets, when it comes to big data the QuickBubbleSort method comes out on top.  

Keep in mind, a very very big design flaw with the algorithm is that any dataset that is not 2^n in size will not work.  

This class is no longer being developed so keep that in mind.
